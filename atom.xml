    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week three went by incredibly fast. We started off recapping data structure accessing techniques and object orientation, and by Tuesday I could really feel the concepts from the previous weeks finally start to sink in.</p>

<p>Of course, just when everything was starting to make sense, we ran full-speed ahead into the next topic! As we dove into database theory and SQL, I could feel the familiar confusion creeping up into everything &ndash; though unlike the utter bafflement I felt for most of last week, this kind of confusion was combined with an unfazed interest in finding out how this stuff works.</p>

<p>At this point, I came to a pretty significant realization. Week two was really rough for me since I tried to do as much work as possible by myself, in an attempt to brute force the knowledge into my brain. Meanwhile, the reality of the situation is that a lot of the time I just don&rsquo;t have the innate understanding of these concepts that some of my more advanced classmates seem to have. I just need more time to truly comprehend what&rsquo;s going on on a meaningful level, and that&rsquo;s really OK.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <div style="float:right"><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MTwJJn0xpeW/embed/postcard" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" text-align="right"></iframe><script async src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p style="text-align:center"><em>Some of the guys came up with a new sport, Pillarball.<br>No fatalities yet!</em></p></div></p>

<p>So, instead of forcing myself to do everything solo and feeling horrifically inadequate and guilty when I come up short, this week I gave in to asking for help even more than I was last week.</p>

<p>Almost immediately this replaced a massive amount of the unnecessary frustration I&rsquo;d been feeling with a better pipeline to understanding the material. Basically, it&rsquo;s a choice between three hours spent staring at a problem without making any headway, or asking for help in the first 30 minutes and spending two and half hours practicing what I just learned. I get so much more valuable practice time with the latter that it&rsquo;s almost bizarre how I haven&rsquo;t been operating like this yet.</p>

<p>Around mid-week, we ended up covering even more material:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Object relational mapping, the paradigm of mapping rows in a database to instances of a class so you can manipulate data through a program that isn&rsquo;t pure SQL;</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby modules, class-like libraries of methods similar to C# namespaces and Javascript packages that let you apply abstracted-out functionality across multiple classes;</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic dispatch via Ruby&rsquo;s .send method, which lets you send an as-yet-unspecified method to a receiver that you can specify on the fly (pretty cool, once you get the gist of it);</p></li>
<li><p>Introspection, a totally insane abstract object-orientated pattern that lets you easily create entire database structures that are completely based on custom data values. This is a complex topic and I don&rsquo;t understand every facet of it yet, but this lecture was MIND-BLOWING!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We also started including directories with files into our applications, which is exciting since it&rsquo;s one small step toward making programs that interact with the outside world.</p>

<p>To summarize, it was a hectic week that went super fast, and I&rsquo;m starting to get the hang of things here. Most importantly, I&rsquo;m grateful for getting a new perspective on how to go about learning for the rest of the class that&rsquo;ll definitely come in handy even outside of programming.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In one of the labs from a few weeks ago, my Ruby class was introduced to named parameters, also known as keyword arguments. These parameters are defined in the method signature with a default value in the format (named_parameter: default_value).</p>

<p>Because their behavior appears similar to standard arguments with default values, most of us were mystified about their purpose. In Ruby, standard arguments with default values appear in the format (standard_argument=default_value). Take a look at the similarities:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As beginners, was there some use for them we just weren&rsquo;t grasping? Or were these named parameters just another option bestowed by the Ruby gods in order afford us more options when coding?</p>

<p>Looking at this in another perspective, if you try to call a standard method with arguments without using any, you get an error:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">drink</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">container</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;Pour me a </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">container</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">, willya?&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">drink</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;glass&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;Pour me a glass, willya?&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">drink</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">#=&gt; ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s logical to assume that named parameters would work the same way. Yet if you try this with a method with named parameters, it still runs &ndash; just like how standard parameters use default values for missing arguments!</p>

<p>While this is helpful to have, it&rsquo;s nothing that we can&rsquo;t do through default parameters.</p>

<p>Then we learned that named parameters don&rsquo;t care about the order in which you call them.</p>

<p>On one hand, neat trick!</p>

<p>On the other hand, who cares? This feature is a nice wrinkle, but it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like it warrants the existence of the function.</p>

<p>After a little digging and experimentation, I finally found a reason why named parameters are worth the trouble: They allow methods to require specifically-named parameters when being invoked, for an added measure of security!</p>

<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll need added security measures beyond just requiring the named parameter. But suddenly, having named parameters available as a tool starts to make sense.</p>

<p>Because standard arguments take input regardless of typing or designation, and because default arguments are fine not taking any input from the method call at all, requiring a named parameter for a method to function gives it a measure of protection against reckless usage.</p>

<p>To strain an already-exhausted metaphor, in certain use cases, named parameters can act exactly like locked doors that require code words in order to grant entry.</p>

    <link href="http://kamoh.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/flatiron-two-week-recap/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-13T23:25:05-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamoh.github.io/blog/2014/06/13/flatiron-two-week-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks two weeks at Flatiron. Just like we&rsquo;ve been prepared for, it&rsquo;s been an emotional and intellectual rollercoaster. The first week was mainly about getting acquainted with git, command line navigation, setting up our environment &ndash; and then we dove right into Ruby.</p>

<p>We closed out the week with a ton of labs designed to test our burgeoning programming skills, and by Saturday my head was crammed so full of new knowledge I had no idea what to make of it.</p>

<p>Week two picked up right where we left off, pushing further into Ruby methods, data structure manipulation, object oriented practices and web scraping.</p>

<p>By the end of the week, I was filled with a totally bizarre combination of emotions &ndash; exhilaration from learning so much, bafflement at still not being able to implement the solutions that I could visualize, disappointment at not understanding at a faster pace, and a surreal sense of accomplishment of how far I&rsquo;ve come in understanding programming logic since the class had begun.</p>

<p>Overall, these first weeks have impressed upon me the supreme importance of working with others to overcome problems, and of shifting your mindset to make room for better solutions to present themselves. One of my main goals for the summer is to develop a better programming mindset when approaching problems, and though there&rsquo;s a long way to go, after these first weeks I can slowly feeling it start to take shape.</p>

    <link href="http://kamoh.github.io/blog/2014/05/27/why-learn-to-program/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-27T10:10:07-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://kamoh.github.io/blog/2014/05/27/why-learn-to-program</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting on the first week of June, I&rsquo;ll be starting as a web development student at the <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. The course is full-time intensive, meeting every day from 9-6 for twelve weeks. Students enter as programming newbies and leave as employed, full-stack web developers.</p>

<p>Since graduating from college, I&rsquo;d been working in the video game industry as a designer and producer. So why the switch to programming?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in how computers work. Though I&rsquo;ve long messed around with light coding, websites and scripting here and there over the past ten years, I&rsquo;ve never sat down to formally learn it (aside from two poorly-taught classes in high school and college). After a <a href="http://weatherlightus.tumblr.com/">friend of mine</a> went through Flatiron&rsquo;s program, his constant praise for the experience piqued my interest, and after getting accepted, I decided to go.</p>

<p>However, curiosity in programming is more than just a long-time interest. The world today runs on software, especially over the web. If you&rsquo;re able to not only understand how the web works, but capable of creating your own tools that leverage it, you wield immense power. I&rsquo;ve always valued being a creator over just being a consumer, and the knowledge I hope to gain from this class will push me even further to the former.</p>

<p>Over the course of the class, I&rsquo;ll be posting updates and thoughts in this blog. It&rsquo;s going to be an interesting summer.</p>
